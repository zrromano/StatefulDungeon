# StatefulDungeon
This project was built as an assignment for my software architecture class. It is a simple turn-based RPG meant to showcase several software design patterns, such as Object Oriented Programming, the Factory method pattern, and the State pattern.

To run the game, install Python and invoke "python game.py" in the main directory. You will be presented with a menu and prompted to play the game through text commands.
